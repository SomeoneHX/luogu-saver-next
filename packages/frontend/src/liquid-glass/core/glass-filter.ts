/**
 * SVG refraction filter for `backdrop-filter: url(#id)`.
 *
 * ## Why an SVG filter at all
 *
 * `backdrop-filter` samples whatever is painted *behind* the element, so the glass never
 * needs a copy of the wallpaper — the browser does the capture. Blur, saturation and
 * brightness map 1:1 onto CSS filter functions. Refraction does not: CSS has no
 * "shift every pixel by a vector field" primitive, so that one effect goes through an SVG
 * filter. `feDisplacementMap` reads a map where R = dx and G = dy (128 = no offset — the exact
 * zero point is 127.5; see the note at the neutral fill in `buildMap`) and shifts each pixel by
 * it.
 *
 * The map itself is generated on a canvas from the rounded-rect signed distance field —
 * the same construction as the AGSL `RoundedRectRefractionShaderString` the Android build
 * runs on API 33+, minus the SDF texture lookup.
 *
 * ## Chromatic aberration
 *
 * The AGSL dispersion shader (`RoundedRectRefractionWithDispersionShaderString`) samples
 * the backdrop 7 times along the refraction offset with spectral weights. `feDisplacementMap`
 * displaces every channel by the *same* vector, so the port bakes the spectral split into
 * three displacement maps — red `base·(1+i)`, green `base`, blue `base·(1−i)` where
 * `i = cx·cy/(hw·hh)` is the shader's `dispersionIntensity` (zero on the axes, strongest in
 * two opposite quadrants) — displaces a channel-isolated copy of the backdrop with each, and
 * re-adds the branches with `feComposite arithmetic`. Three taps instead of seven: the
 * cross-channel bleed of the middle spectral bands is dropped, which at a few px of
 * dispersion is visually indistinguishable, and white is conserved either way.
 *
 * The `chromaticAberration` uniform is a *boolean* upstream (`Lens.kt` passes a constant
 * `1f`), so the dispersion field depends only on geometry and bakes into the maps; the
 * animation knob stays `refractionAmount`, which every branch is linear in.
 *
 * ## SDF text (`SdfShader`)
 *
 * `LockScreenContent` refracts a *baked* field rather than a rounded rect. `clock_sdf` is a
 * 1599×515 texture whose channels are a signed distance, its unit normal and a coverage mask, and
 * the Android build hands it to a runtime shader. Nothing about the map format changes here — the
 * only difference is where the distance and its normal come from. `buildSdfMap` is `buildMap` with
 * a different field source and the same encoder, the same cache, the same `scale` knob.
 *
 * Two things the shader does that `feDisplacementMap` cannot, and what stands in for each:
 *
 *  - `content.eval(refractedCoord) * v.a` masks the result by the shape's coverage. The lens
 *    element already carries a `mask-image` for the `AlphaMask` shader, and this texture's alpha
 *    channel *is* a coverage mask, so the same mechanism takes it (`GlassSurface`).
 *  - the bevel tail is two `color *= 1 + k` applications. Both collapse into one multiplier
 *    `1 + α`, baked to an image and applied with `feComposite arithmetic k1 = k3 = 1` — see
 *    `buildBevelMap`.
 *
 * Decoding is not here: this module takes texels, never a URL, so it stays evaluable outside a
 * browser and liftable into the userscript unchanged.
 *
 * ## Chromium-only
 *
 * `url()` inside `backdrop-filter` is a Chromium extension (Chrome / Edge 76+). Safari and
 * Firefox accept the declaration but paint nothing for it, so call sites must always keep a
 * plain `blur()` declaration in an *earlier* rule — see `GlassSurface.vue`. Everything else
 * the glass needs is plain CSS and works everywhere.
