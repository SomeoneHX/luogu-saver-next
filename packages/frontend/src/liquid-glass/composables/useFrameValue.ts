/**
 * Mirrors a value that is driven by the animation runtime into a Vue ref so it can be used
 * in templates (e.g. the slider fill width, the bottom-tabs indicator offset).
 *
 * The animation values are intentionally *outside* Vue's reactivity — they are plain JS
 * stepped by the shared frame loop — so `animationRevision` is the invalidation signal.
 *
 * The getter is evaluated **inside the watch source**, not inside the callback. That matters:
 * a `watch` source runs in an effect scope, so every reactive read the getter makes — a
 * `useElementMetrics` size, an exposed `GlassSurface.size`, a theme flag — registers as a
 * dependency and re-runs the source. Calling the getter in the callback instead would track
 * only `animationRevision`, and a value that is *also* a function of layout would then stay
 * frozen at its pre-layout reading until some animation happened to bump the revision.
 *
 * That was a real bug: `LiquidSlider` computes its thumb offset from the track width, which is
 * 0 until `measure()` runs in `onMounted`. The thumb rendered at `-size/2` (hanging off the
 * left edge, fill empty) and only jumped to its true position — dead centre at `value = 50` —
 * on the first press, because `press()` was the first thing to start a spring and bump the
 * revision. The value was never wrong, just never invalidated.
